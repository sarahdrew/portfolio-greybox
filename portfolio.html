            Hi, I'm Sarah Drew, a full stack web development student and 
            aspiring full stack web developer. I'd like to develop the web.

            <p>I'm a student of the Engineering Immersion bootcamp at Thinkful. In the next few months I will master HTML, CSS, AJAX, React, SQL, and the balance of working from home while still getting enough fresh air. I enjoy traversing and manipulating the DOM, learning API Documentation, and find creative solutions to unique problems.</p>
            <p>In the hours I am offline, I perform improv comedy, draw, and hangout with my mean cat, Cheddar.</p>
